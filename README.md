# DBM-Poll-System

Creates a poll/vote system. For it to work, it you either have to change the actions to fit your server or follow the instructions. 

# Set up:
- The only people who can make Polls are Nitro Boosters and people with a role called 'Server VIP', make sure those names match, or change the actions. 
- Make sure you have a channel named #🏛┊polls, this is where the polls will be sent.
